Moonshine jugs
==============

A friend started learning pottery, so I sarcastically made moonshine jugs in Blender, so I could send her a picture of my own pottery.

Development steps
-----------------

Jugs were modelled in Blender (producing [Moonshine jugs.blend](Moonshine%20jugs.blend)), and then rendered to make [Moonshine jugs.png](Moonshine%20jugs.png).

[Moonshine jug.stl](Moonshine%20jug.stl) and [Moonshine jug 2.stl](Moonshine%20jug%202.stl) were exported from Blender. They were then scaled up 20 times to produce [Moonshine jug (x20).stl](Moonshine%20jug%20(x20).stl) and [Moonshine jug 2 (x20).stl](Moonshine%20jug%202%20(x20).stl) for 3D printing.
